The model and data abstraction defined in section~\ref{sec:mdAbstract} is a view
for distributed computing of a large scale machine learning problem. This
abstraction can be separated logically from the way the learning phase of the 
problem. The partition abstraction is used to distribute the learning phase over
different computig units. For example in the

%In this section, we describe how optimization techniques, and in particular
%stochastic gradient descent, can be used to fit a variety of machine learning

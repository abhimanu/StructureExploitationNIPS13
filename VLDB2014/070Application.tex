We demonstrate that \method is a generic large scale machine learning system by
applying it over diverse set of real world problems that are non-trivial to
solve. We describe here a set of problems in machine learning from the sub-areas
of natural language processing, computer vision and computational social
sciences. These applications are real world problems that involve non-trivial
complexity described in section~\ref{sec:complexQues}

\subsection{Latent dirichlet allocation (\lda)}
We descibed \lda in detail in section~\ref{sec:mdAbstract}. We further elaborate
on the problem here.
